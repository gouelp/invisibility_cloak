# invisibility_cloak

Projet to create an invisibility cloak like the one in Harry Potter

This projet is based on OpenCV library. 

As the project is designed for ROS it doesn't handle the image recording and, instead, subscribe to a ROS topic that does. 

The main version is based on red color detection but it is easy to modify it to adapt your situation
